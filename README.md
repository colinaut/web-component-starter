## Web Component Starter

Basic bare bones native web component starter without a framework. Uses Vite. Includes examples for Light DOM and Shadow DOM web components using Typescript or vanilla JavaScript.

Created this as I couldn't find a good web component starter that didn't use Lit. Lit is great and all but sometimes it's way more than I need. There are some out there but they either use Webpack or Glup â€” Vite is much nicer for developing with.

Build script automatically copies to docs folder for github pages.
